## About MINI-TEAM_DEV-85

MINI-TEAM_DEV-85 is a web application that people can share their diaries. You can not only post, edit, delete our posts but also like, comment your friends' posts. Moreover, we can retrieve and sort posts in certain ways. It is like a simple Instagram. You can share your updates and communicate with your friends using this application.
This application was built in 10 days by Rinto and Hikaru.
Rinto mainly worked on the server-side.
Hikaru mainly worked on the frontend.
The difficult parts were the iterative process of the index screen and the ability to filter liked posts.In both cases,
the CSS was not loading properly,and by carefully reviewing the bootstrap settings and blade file descriptions,we were able to identify
and resolve the cause.
Creating the comment function was also challenging.
At first, whenever we tried to submit a comment, it wasnâ€™t accepted and the page simply reloaded.
We spent a lot of time solving this problem. Although we used ChatGPT, it sometimes made the issue more complicated.
In addition, we were confused by conflicts on GitHub. From this experience, we also learned how to use ChatGPT more effectively.
